# LunaDiscordBot

Okay, let's do this. Simple stuff here, we're just gonna make a bot that welcomes new members and sends them to the general channel. For now. Will use issues as a functionality to-do list. And this readme will change a lot, so... yeah!

## Features (for now)

-   Welcome new members
-   Send boost messages
-   Detect unverified roles
    -   Ban unverified users
-   Say command
